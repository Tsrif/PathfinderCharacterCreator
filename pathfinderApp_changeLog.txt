	- Have a Skill object that will hold all the data 
	- Have a function that creates the skillPanel

	- And a way to change information on them after they've been created

- Added a temporary button for creating skills 
- When a skill panel is created, it is placed beneath the last skill panel that was created 
- Each component in a newly created skill panel inherits their default properties from a skill panel template 

- added auto scroll to skills tab
- Program can now make requests to backend to get detailed information on all of the skills
- Program can take detailed skills information and create appropriate skill panels 
- For now* Request are made at start of program(Which really slows it down), and all panels are created from the "Add all" button on skills page (Which also lags the program for a second)
- removed some print statements 

/*SHIT TO DO*/
- attack Bonus increases are manual for now???
- ability mods should be labels?
- Not in line for some things 
- Fix tabbing issue 
- UI fine tuning 
- Fix saving???
- add in a scrolling feature to the skills page if the amount of skills exceed x amount of skills
